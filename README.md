In order to run the code, please open the TSP1.py file and copy the code. From there, open either an online python server or a local one on your computer. If you would like to download a python server to your desktop, please download python from this link (only for windows): https://www.python.org/downloads/, and the server atom from this link (for both Windows and Mac): https://atom.io/. Once the python server is open, paste the code and save it as a .py file under the name TSP1. If running the code on an online server, open a terminal within the same server and run the code by typing “python TSP1.py” and pressing enter. If you are running the code on your desktop, open the command prompt on your desktop and follow the directions outlined on this website: http://pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/. From there, follow the directions in the code and enjoy! Safe and short travels!

Note: This code is written in python version 2.6. In order to correctly run the code, please use version 2.6 of Python.
