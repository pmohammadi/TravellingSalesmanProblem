In order to run the code, please open the TSP1.py file and copy the code. From there, open either an online python server or a local one on your computer. Paste the code and save it as a .py file under the name TSP1. Open a terminal within the same server and run the code by typing “python TSP1.py” and pressing enter. From there, follow the directions in the code. Please let me know if you run into any questions or ideas on how to alter our method.
